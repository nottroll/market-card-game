## Market Making Card Game
# Goal
Maximise profit over a series of trading rounds.

# How to Play
You will be presented with a set of cards. Some of these cards may be turned face up, while others remain face down. The market maker will quote a bid and ask spread that the player will trade with.

# Market Maker Quote
The market maker quote is displayed as X at Y where:
- X (Bid): The price the market maker is willing to buy at.
- Y (Ask): The price the market maker is willing to sell at. 

# Trading
- The player starts with a budget of 500 by default.
- The player chooses whether to buy or sell and the number of units to trade

# Valid Position
- The player needs to ensure that their position is valid.
- For any long position, the player must be able to afford the total bid order.
- For any short position, the player's balance must be able to cover the maximum possible loss.

# Outcome
Once you make your decision, the game reveals all cards and the player must report their realised profit or a loss.

# Market Events
Market events may randomly occur each round.
